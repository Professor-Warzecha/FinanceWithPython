# FinanceWithPython

The following python .py file is a very simple retirement robo-advisor that helps financially unedcuated people save for their retirement. It serves a fiduciary purpose of allocating investment risk tolerance based on time until retirement and creates a portfolio for the user based on some simple preferences. It DOES NOT account for inflation, bear markets, or volatility but primarly on the past 10 year annual return average.
